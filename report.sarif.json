If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::\n> \n> xstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\n> xstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n> However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n\n\n\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-674](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/674.html)\n\n","text":"XStream is vulnerable to denial-of-service due to a stack overflow that exists due to a recursive hash set calculation.

Following types of the Java runtime are affected:\n>\n> * java.util.HashMap\n> * java.util.HashSet\n> * java.util.Hashtable\n> * java.util.LinkedHashMap\n> * java.util.LinkedHashSet\n> Other third party collection implementations that use their element's hash code may also be affected\n> A simple solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream.\n> \n> If your object graph does not use referenced elements at all, you may simply set the NO_REFERENCE mode:\n> \n> XStream xstream = new XStream();\n> xstream.setMode(XStream.NO_REFERENCES);\n> If your object graph contains neither a Hashtable, HashMap nor a HashSet (or one of the linked variants of it) then you can use the security framework to deny the usage of these types:\n> \n> XStream xstream = new XStream();\n> xstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{\n>  java.util.HashMap.class, java.util.HashSet.class, java.util.Hashtable.class, java.util.LinkedHashMap.class, java.util.LinkedHashSet.class\n> });\n> Unfortunately these types are very common. If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::\n> \n> xstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\n> xstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n> However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n## Locations\n* /BOOT-INF/lib/xstream-1.4.5.jar#target/webgoat-2025.4-SNAPSHOT.jar\n\n\n\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-674](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/674.html)\n\n","text":"XStream is vulnerable to denial-of-service due to a stack overflow that exists due to a recursive hash set calculation.
